        # --- IMPORTANT: LOCATION HEADER REWRITE CHALLENGE ---
        # Traefik's standard 'headers' middleware can add/set/remove headers.
        # It DOES NOT support dynamic string manipulation or conditional logic
        # based on the original request host AND the response's Location header
        # to reconstruct a new URL like your Lua script does.
        #
        # Example of simple header modification (NOT your complex logic):
        # - name: my-simple-header-middleware@kubernetescrd
        #
        # To achieve your specific Lua logic, you would need to:
        # 1. Write a custom Traefik plugin in Go.
        # 2. Deploy that plugin to your Traefik instance.
        # 3. Reference it here:
        #    - name: your-custom-location-rewrite-plugin@kubernetescrd
